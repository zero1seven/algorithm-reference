# algorithm-reference
This repository can be used as a psuedocode, growth rate, and basic code reference for various common algorithms.

The algorithms in this repository are well known and existing code is available to solve them. This repository is meant to put many of these common algorithms in a single location for learning purposes. I will try to make each implementation as easy as possible, avoiding abstractions, and implementation specific concerns.

Students, please do not copy/paste these algorithms for your homework. I do not condone academic dishonesty. However, these references may be valuable for when you forget how an algorithm works or need to learn an unfamiliar one. Feel free to download the algorithm to review and test.

More algorithms to come over time.
